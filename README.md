# OpenAI-API-Setup
random GPT bot spam for random website

GPT Bots were made using the ChatGPT interface. These were linked via API Keys to the Python file, which provides a custom front-end look, rather than ChatGPT's boring screen. It also by-passes the requirement for a OpenAI subscription to access the custom GPT bots. 

Feel free to use this for personal development, its all available online anyways.
